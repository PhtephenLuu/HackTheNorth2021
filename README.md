# HackTheNorth2021 ![python tests](https://github.com/PhtephenLuu/HackTheNorth2021/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Hello and welcome to our HackTheNorth2021 group project! We created a COVID dashboard for Canada using Python, Plotly and Dash. The visualizations display data gathered from the OpenCovid API [https://opencovid.ca/api/](https://opencovid.ca/api/). 

## Installation
First navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and then install all the packages via pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment 
This app is hosted using Heroku. If you would like to host your own version, please follow the instructions given by [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-your-dash-app-to-heroku-the-magical-guide-39bd6a0c586c). A word of advice, do not use static files as they make the hosting process 10x harder. 

Take a look at our [project](https://htn2021covid.herokuapp.com) and [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/hackthenorth2021)!
